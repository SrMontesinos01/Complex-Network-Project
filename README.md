# Complex Network Project
 
This project explores the structural and functional properties of a brain network using network analysis techniques. The study investigates various network measures, including degree distribution, centrality measures, small-world properties, and community detection algorithms. The analysis reveals that the brain network exhibits characteristics of a small-world network, facilitating efficient information processing through high clustering and short average path lengths. Community detection algorithms identify distinct communities within the network, with the Louvain method and greedy optimization algorithm yielding the most consistent results. Network visualization illustrates the interconnected nature of communities, with a distinct central area where nodes exhibit high values of different centrality measures. Overall, the study provides insights into the organizational principles of the brain network, highlighting its complex yet efficient architecture.
